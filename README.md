# consuming-github

On this test you will have to consume the GitHub APIs.

The endpoints' documentation that you will use for this test are available at:

https://developer.github.com/v3/
https://developer.github.com/v3/users/
https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/

Create an API that will proxy all client requests to the appropriate GitHub endpoint. The following endpoints must be provided:

GET - /api/users?since={number}
This endpoint must return a list of GitHub users and the link for the next page.

GET - /api/users/:username/details
This endpoint must return the details of a GitHub user

GET - /api/users/:username/repos
This endpoint must return a list with all user repositories
